So, I decided to start a blog.  A technical blog where I document my projects, fumblings with various technologies, and other tech musings.

Just having a blog will be a new experience for me.  It will be an interesting journey as I explore C++ development, business analysis and business intelligence techniques, and cloud-based development.

I hope that you will enjoy reading my posts and sharing this journey with me.

Till next post :)
